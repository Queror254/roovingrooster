                <p>                  
                    Roof maintenance is vital to the longevity of any RV. Inspections should be done every three to six months. It’s much
                    cheaper to replace a skylight when you notice small cracks forming than it is to replace a section of the roof. It’s
                    also a good time to inspect all the seams and touch up any lap sealant that’s needed. Lap sealant will also need to be
                    reapplied every twelve to eighteen months. After three applications of lap sealant it is recommended that the old lap
                    sealant be removed and new lap sealant applied.
                    
                    Inspections price <span>$95</span>. Small areas of lap sealant will be reapplied. Recommend every 3 months
                    
                    Inspection and reapplication $150-$300. Depending on the size of the RV. All seams will have lap sealant reapplied.
                    Recommend every twelve to eighteen months.
                    
                    Inspection and replacement $150-$300+ depending on the size of the RV. Lap sealant degrades over time. Exposure to the
                    sun and elements accelerates that degradation.
                    
                    It’s important to remember that a small leak can lead to $10,000+ in damages before you can see anything from the inside
                    of your RV.

                    AC maintenance is impossible to keeping the inside of your comfortable. It’s also important for the longevity of your
                    RV.
                    
                    Cleaning AC coils $95.
                    Keeping the coils clean helps you AC last longer by reducing the workload on the cooling system it’s self. Clean coils
                    work more efficiently and will cool the RV faster while keeping you cooler on exceptionally hot days.
                    
                    AC components inspected $95.
                    Components go bad over time. It’s important that all the AC components are in good working order. A cheap $20 part going
                    out can put a strain on the more expensive motor and compressor. Most motors can be replaced for $300-$500 but if the
                    compressor goes bad then the entire AC will need to be replaced. That can cost from $1800-$2400+.
                    
                    Recommend AC inspection every six to twelve months.

                    Furnaces,like the AC, is important to keeping the comfort inside your RV during the cold months. A failure in the
                    furnace can also be a safety issue. Cracks in the heat exchanger can lead to carbon monoxide getting into your rv. All
                    of the safety fears on your furnace are designed to prevent the furnace from over heating. That is why I recommend
                    checking carbon monoxide detector regularly and replacement it every five to seven years and as needed due to unexpected
                    failures.
                    
                    Secondary to the safety issues is the comfort that the furnace gives you during the cold months. Every component on the
                    furnace is designed for safety before comfort and any one of those components can stop your furnace from working. With
                    our training here at Roving Rooster RV maintenance and repair will diagnose whatever is wrong with your furnace and get
                    you living in comfort again.

                    Water heater maintenance $95-$200.
                    Water heater maintenance is greatly dependent on your location. If your frequently in an area with hard water then you
                    will have more scale build up. If your water heater is taking longer to heat your water than it used to then you may
                    have scale building up in your hot water tank. Fortunately we can have your water heater quickly making hot water again
                    in just a few hours.
